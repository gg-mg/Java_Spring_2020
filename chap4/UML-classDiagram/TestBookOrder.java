/** Program header:  TestBookOrder.java
 *
 * Author:    John Doe
 * Class:     Java  Online
 *
 * Brief Program Description:
 *   This class is the application class with the main method.
 *   It asks for user input parameters to initialize book orders.
 *   Then it creates two objects using two different constructors, respectively. 
 *   For the object created with default object, it uses setters to customize various object data.  
 *   Then it calculates and output the object characteristics such as date and price.

	/** The line above does not compile, because it violates the encapsulation

	 *  The correct way is to access private data member via its public getter:
	 *	  myOrder.getUnitPrice();
	 *  Please try this: uncomment line 83 and try to compile it, and you will 
	 *    see the compilation error message as:
	 *	      the field unitPrice has private access in BookOrder
	 *	Explanation: a private field in class BookOrder if not visible by any other 
	 *	  class, such as this class TestBookOrder.
	 *  The solution is to replace the direct access of private data with
	 *	  a public method (which is visible by any other class), as stated above in line 87.
