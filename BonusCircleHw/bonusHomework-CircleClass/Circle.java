/** Program header:  Circle.java
 *
 * Author:    John Doe
 * Class:     Java Online
 *
 * Brief Program Description:
 *   This sample Circle class defines its private data: radius, 
 *     and a list of public methods including constructors, getters, setters and effectors. 
 *   You should follow the same template to code OOP class with private data and public methods.
 *   The application class that makes use of this Circle class is named TestCircle.

// Implement the requirement of Circle class under each block comment below.
public class Circle  
{
	/** define a private data named radius, and the data type is double */

	/** provide a default public constructor with no parameter. 
	    inside the constructor, use this() statement and plug in 2.5 as parameter */

		
	/** provide the second public constructor that takes one parameter of double type. 
	    inside the constructor, use the formal parameter to initialize the private data member */

		
	/** provide a public getter method for the private data member */

	
	/** provide a public setter method for the private data member */

	
	/** provide a public effector method named calculateArea that takes no parameter, and it has return type double.
	    inside the method, calculate the area of the circle based on the private data member: radius, 
	    and then return the calculated result: the area. You need to use Math.PI in the calculation */

		
	/** provide a public effector method named calculatePerimeter with no parameter, and it has return type double.
	    inside the method, calculate the perimeter of the circle based on the private data member; radius, 
	    and then return the calculated result: the perimeter. You need to use Math.PI in the calculation */

		
	/** provide a public effector method named calculateTotalCost that takes one parameter of double type, 
		and its method return type is double. The formal parameter represents the cost per unit area, 
		and you need to have a self-explaining name for this formal parameter.
	    inside the method, calculate the total cost by multiplying the formal parameter with this circle's area,  
	    and its area can be obtained by calling method calculateArea() that is defined above. 
	    the last statement of the method is to return the calculated result: total cost */
