	The seahorse is the main actor. The left, right, bottom, and up, buttons adjust the position of the seahorse. 
The strategy is for the seahorse to catch the crabs and fish, while avoiding the sea urchin stings within the given
time. The seahorse turns chocolate color when fish is eaten and turns red when a crab is eaten. At the start of the game,
the seahorse has an unattractive color because of hunger. The seahorse color changes when she catches food.She has to 
avoid the sea urchin because the sea urchin spikes are poisonus. She turns yellow when spiked by the seahorses.

to restart the game.
