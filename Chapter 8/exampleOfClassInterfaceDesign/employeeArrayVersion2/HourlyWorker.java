/** Program header:  HourlyWorker.java
 *
 * Author:    John Doe
 * Class:     Java Online
 *
 * Brief Program Description:
 *   This class extends from class Employee, and implements interface Payable. 
 *   It has concrete implementations for all inherited abstract methods from interface Payable, 
 *     thus this class does not need to be defined as abstract. 
 *   It defines two private data fields: hours and rate.
 *   It also provides a default constructor and a constructor with four parameters,  
 *     in addition to the regular getters and setters for all private data members.
 *   The effector is use to calculate the take-home income after tax.
 *   It also provide its own version of toString() method.
