/** Program header:  PayrollArrayDemo.java
 *
 * Author:    John Doe
 * Class:     Java  Online
 *
 * Brief Program Description:
 *   This class is the application class that has the main method.
 *   It creates an array of superclass type, then initialize it with objects of different subclass types.
 *   It follows the class-interface design in version 1, and the array can be navigated with dynamic binding, 
 *		without having to know the exact subclass type of each array element. 
 *   It calculates and output each array item's characteristics.
 *   It creates methods and passes array as parameters, and it uses for-each loop and regular for loop to 
 *     navigate an array of objects.

		    Payable[] list = new Employee[4];
		  and the reason is that: Employee "is-a" Payable through the 
		  inheritance relationship, as defined in the Employee class header.  
		  Java keyword "extends" implies "strong" inheritance relationship, and
		  Java keyword "implements" implies "weak" inheritance relationship, 
		  and no matter weak or strong, they both have the "is-a" 
		  inheritance relationship: subclass "is-a" superclass.
