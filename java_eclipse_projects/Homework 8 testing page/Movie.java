*
* Author:    George Gichuki
* Class:     Monday and Wednesday 11.00  to 13.45
*
* Brief Program Description:
*   This is the superclass Movie which is defined as abstract because it does not implement
*    what it inherits from the interface. 
*   Four private data fields are defined with public setters and getters provided after 
*    the constructors. The constructors are two; a default constructor and a constructor
*   with four parameters.   
*   The overridden toString() method is originally defined in class Object, 
*   and all other classes are either direct subclasses of Object, or more generations 
*   down from ancestor class Object. 
*   For Employee class, because it does not explicitly declare its extended superclass , 
*   class Object is assigned as its superclass by default.
